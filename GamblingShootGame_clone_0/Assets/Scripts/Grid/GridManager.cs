/*
 * GridManager Script:
 * 
 * This script is responsible for managing two grids, each containing 9 buttons. Player 1 controls Grid 1 and Player 2 controls Grid 2. 
 * Each player can only interact with the grid they are assigned to, and their actions (button clicks) are synchronized across both players
 * using Photon PUN 2 for multiplayer support.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * 1. We check if the current player is the MasterClient (Player 1) or the other player (Player 2).
 * 2. Depending on which player is connected, we enable or disable their gridâ€™s buttons.
 * 3. When a player clicks a button on their grid, the button becomes unclickable for both players, and a counter specific to that grid 
 *    is incremented.
 * 4. This is done using Photon RPC calls to synchronize button states and counters across the network.
